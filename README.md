# SimpleGame

I had to create a simple game where the player can move around
the screen by using the up, down, left and right arrows and must avoid
colliding with the ‘enemy’ to win.

* The game had to include the following:
  * At least 3 ‘enemy’ objects. The enemies should all move across the
    screen from different positions. If the player object collides with any
    enemy object, they lose, and the game ends.
  * At least 1 ‘prize’ object. If the player object collides with the prize
    object, they win, and the game ends.
